{"title":  "Monkey menace goes nowhere despite tall poll promises", "content": "Farmers say shrinking cultivation and expanding forest cover around abandoned land have unintentionally increased monkey habitats and worsening the human-wildlife conflict. Local production of traditional crops has declined, and some farmers have shifted to less risky crops or seasonal work outside agriculture. The growing human-wildlife conflict mirrors patterns reported in hill districts across Nepal, where wildlife conservation successes have sometimes increased pressure on farming communities without adequate mitigation measures. As the House of Representatives polls approach, monkey menace has been a major election agenda in Dhankuta, a hill district in Koshi province. Election candidates have once again made monkey control a campaign issue, promising fencing, compensation schemes, and stronger wildlife management policies."}
{"title": "Nepal’s new constitution: A decade of challenges and progress", "content": "Nepal’s new constitution, promulgated in 2015, marked a significant milestone in the country’s political history, transitioning from a monarchy to a federal democratic republic. However, the journey has been fraught with challenges, including political instability, social unrest, and issues related to federalism. The constitution aimed to address long-standing issues of representation and inclusion, but implementation has been slow and contentious. Despite these challenges, there have been notable achievements, such as the establishment of a federal structure, increased political participation, and efforts to promote social justice. As Nepal continues to navigate its constitutional journey, the focus remains on addressing the gaps in implementation and ensuring that the promises of the constitution are realized for all citizens."}
